Stone has been a Washington insider for the last 40 years and played a key role in the election of Republican presidents Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Roger argues that just as the assassination of JFK prevents a balanced analysis of Kennedy and his times, the myth of Watergate prevents a reappraisal of the 37th President. Roger reveals how the Kennedy’s wiretapped Nixon’s hotel room and stole Nixon's medical records. He outlines how White House Counsel John Dean, planned, pushed and covered-up the Watergate break-in, then sought to avoid responsibility for it. Stone tells us about the bungled Watergate break-in to determine what exactly Nixon’s agents were looking for and how the CIA infiltrated the burglar team and sabotaged the break-in to gain leverage over Nixon. In the second hour, we discuss the JFK assassination as one event in a series of corrupt events. Also, we’ll talk about the upcoming 2016 election and the chances of putting a Libertarian Party candidate on the ballot. Stone tells us how the Republicans and Democrats are turning into the same party...http://nixonsecrets.com/^Red Ice Radio^http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWpJ7ubN_6g^2014-11-27 01:20:43

F1 2015: Future of Nico Hulkenberg^Following his victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans this weekend with Porsche alongside Earl Bamber & Nick Tandy.

Newell Rubbermaid’s Stock Is Surging Because of Pens and Water Bottles?^Newell Rubbermaid’s (NWL) strong Q2 results were boosted by hearty sales of innovative new Sharpie magic markers, Contigo and Bubba water bottles, and even Baby Jogger strollers and Graco carseats. The gains in areas reflect ongoing efforts to diversify into new categories at major retailers globally. ‘A huge part of what’s driving the strong performance is the quality and strength of our innovation,’ said Newell Rubbermaid president and CEO Michael Polk in an interview with TheStreet. Newell Rubbermaid’s second quarter sales rose 4% to $1.56 billion, beating consensus forecasts of $1.54 billion. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, what Newell Rubbermaid refers to as 'core sales' increased 5.1% year over year. The second quarter’s sales growth was led by the company’s writing and baby segments, where core sales rose 10.8% and 6.0%, respectively. Sales of water bottles were also strong. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share came in $0.64, surpassing Wall Street’s estimate for $0.62. The company hiked its full year sales forecast to 4% to 5%, from 3.5% to 4.5% previously. Earnings per share are now seen reaching $2.14 to $2.20, compared to previous guidance of $2.10 to $2.18. The strength of the second quarter, and guidance lift added more fuel to Newell Rubbermaid shares, which have now gained an impressive 13% year to date. Over the past year, the stock has surged about 30%, easily outperforming the 6.6% gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 8.5% advance for the S&P 500...Subscribe to TheStreetTV on YouTube:   http://t.st/TheStreetTV..For more content from TheStreet visit: http://thestreet.com.Check out all our videos: http://youtube.com/user/TheStreetTV.Follow TheStreet on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thestreet.Like TheStreet on Facebook: http://facebook.com/TheStreet.Follow TheStreet on LinkedIn: http://linkedin.com/company/theStreet.Follow TheStreet on Google+: http://plus.google.com/+TheStreet^TheStreet^http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sJUYz9obF8^2015-08-03 19:53:05

ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Response - Law Offices of John Phillips, Jacksonville, Florida^http://courtsandsportsradio.com/2013/08/15/you-better-believe-we-must-do-more/ - WJXT's Nikki Kimbleton challenged us to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.  We accepted...ALS..ALS is a disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement that sometimes hits people in the prime of life.  I have had friends experience this...Challenge..The "challenge" is simple: Once challenged, donate $100 or douse yourself with iced water, record it and pass the challenge on to others via social media.  It all started with Pete Frates, a former baseball player at Boston College who has been living with ALS since 2012. He floated the idea and his former teammates, as well as other Boston-area athletes, took him up on it. It was noticed and covered by local media and that attention, along with the social Web's viral nature, launched it onto a much larger stage. Best ones we've found? Go here- http://courtsandsportsradio.com/2014/08/15/top-20-ice-bucket-challenge-videos-for-als...The campaign is clearly working. The ALS Association reports that it, and its 38 chapters, received $4 million in donations in just two weeks. Last year during that same time period, July 29-August 12, the association brought in $1.1 million.  Great news for the 12,000 Americans who have the disease, which is devastating and ultimately fatal, and for their families and future generations...ALS..According to the ALS Association, up to 30,000 people in the United States currently have ALS, an incurably fatal disease among primarily 40- to 70- year-old men that results in the swift and steady atrophy of all voluntary muscle movements. The other statistic cites is that ALS affects 1 or 2:100,000 people. Symptoms can begin with “ticks” or breakdowns in the nervous system, such as shaking or immobilization of limbs and extends over the course of a few months or years to quadriplegia, paraplegia and death. Many people with ALS retain their full mental capacity, which at first is a blessing but later on becomes a real curse, as they are trapped in a shell of a body, communicating by computer generated speech guided by eye movement. The British astrophysicist, Stephen Hawking, is such an example. He has lived longer than most with a fully functioning, and some say genius brain, inside a body that has wasted away...Treatment..There is no known cure for ALS. The first drug treatment for the disease is a medicine called Riluzole. Riluzole may prolong life, but does not reverse or stop the disease from getting worse. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms. Baclofen or diazepam may be used to control spasticity that interferes with activities of daily living. Trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline may be prescribed for people with problems swallowing their own saliva. Physical therapy, rehabilitation, use of braces or a wheelchair, or other orthopedic measures may be needed to maximize muscle function and general health. Choking is common. Patients may decide to have a tube placed into their stomach for feeding. This is called a gastrostomy. A nutritionist is very important to help prevent weight loss. The illness itself appears to increase the need for food and there is usually limited ability to swallow. The use of devices to assist in breathing includes machines that are only used at night as well as constant mechanical ventilation. Patients should discuss their wishes regarding artificial ventilation with their families and doctors. It can be horrible and is expensive...Lou Gehrig..Baseball legend, Lou Gehrig was its first prominent alleged victim, dying two years after his 1939 diagnosis. The Yankee's legend had a well-documented history of significant concussions on the baseball field, and perhaps others sustained as a battering-ram football halfback in high school and at Columbia University. Given that, it’s possible that Gehrig’s renowned commitment to playing through injuries like concussions, which resulted in his legendary record streak of playing in 2,130 consecutive games over 14 years, could have led to his condition...Causes..In about 10% of cases, ALS is caused by a genetic defect. In other cases, the cause is unknown. Nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body. The condition slowly gets worse. When the muscles in the chest area stop working, it becomes hard or impossible to breathe on one's own...Here's to you, Kevin Turner.  We love you.^Law Offices of John M.

Rev. Bill Hassel (2012 Mary Lou Krauseneck Courage & Love Honoree)^Reverend Bill Hassel was the 2012 recipient of the Mary Lou Krauseneck Courage & Love award presented at ALS TDI's 8th annual Leadership Summit...Reverend Hassel was nominated by his peers for this award and chosen for several reasons:..• He is a 5 year ALS survivor, but from the beginning of his diagnosis, he was and is still driven to participate in awareness, fundraising and patient care.  ..• He started a support group for people with ALS (PALS) in Victoria, TX. It all started with his frustration with being asked to drive from Victoria, TX to Houston, TX for a support group meeting. The trip took 2 hours each way and was just not travel friendly for an ALS patient. So undaunted, Bill started his own Support Group in Victoria, a city of 60,000 with 5 ALS cases of which one passed recently and another diagnosed. This group meets on a monthly basis and is led by Bill...• He was instrumental in the making of the documentary "Breadth of Hope," which was produced, directed and filmed by Drew Stewart. It is an ALS advocacy and awareness film in which the lives and challenges of living with ALS of the Victoria, TX PALS is brought to the forefront. ..• He started a family-oriented annual event named  the "Stroll, Roll N Run" which has raised over $86,000 for research at ALS TDI in just 3 years. This event starts with an interfaith ecumenical ceremony followed by race. Many families in the Victoria area attend and obviously support Bill's efforts. One of the major sponsors is Nolan Ryan, president and part owner of the Texas Rangers. Nolan donates all the food for the event and Bill has made this happen...• Bill worked with Nolan Ryan and Drew Stewart in 2011 to create a PSA for ALS and ALS TDI which was broadcast by some of the TV stations Bill contacted before the World Series started. This year Bill has challenged himself to contact every TV station in the US to ask them to run the PSA...• He introduced ALS TDI to Sophia Smith, an incredibly successful senior executive and member of the Avon sales leadership team who was diagnosed with ALS. This introduction led to an "AVON" fundraising campaign which raised over $70,000 for research at ALS TDI.^ALS Therapy Development Institute^http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRC-ZaZhVsI^2012-11-16 18:59:17

Standard Pacific, Ryland Combine Forces to Become the Fourth Largest U.S. Homebuilder^Southern California home builders Standard Pacific Corp. (SPF) and Ryland Group Inc. (RYL) on Monday revealed plans to unite, creating a $5.2 billion company that would rank as the fourth-largest home builder in the United States. Terms of the deal call for Irvine-based Standard Pacific to execute a 1-for-5 reverse stock split and then issue 1.0191 shares for each share of Ryland. Based on Friday closing prices the exchange rate offers little to no premium for holders of Westlake Village-based Ryland. Post-deal Standard Pacific holders would own about 59% of the combination, which will be run by Ryland CEO Larry Nicholson with Standard Pacific CEO Scott Stowell acting as chairman of the board. Current Ryland chief operating officer Peter Skelly and current Standard Pacific CFO Jeff McCall will continue in those roles for the combined company. The companies said the combination would have an enterprise value of about $8.2 billion and own or control about 74,000 home-sites. The two builders together offer neighborhoods from entry level to luxury across 41 markets in 17 states, creating a company that should have the scale and diversity to survive a downturn in any particular geography...Subscribe to TheStreetTV on YouTube:   http://t.st/TheStreetTV..For more content from TheStreet visit: http://thestreet.com.Check out all our videos: http://youtube.com/user/TheStreetTV.Follow TheStreet on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thestreet.Like TheStreet on Facebook: http://facebook.com/TheStreet.Follow TheStreet on LinkedIn: http://linkedin.com/company/theStreet.Follow TheStreet on Google+: http://plus.google.com/+TheStreet^TheStreet^http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlpipVGJCg4^2015-06-15 19:38:33

A Zombie Purchasing An Annuity & Life Insurance^I work at Genworth, an insurance company. I have been with Genworth for about a year and have learned so much about insurance – things a lot of people my age don’t consider. When I learned about the Genworth #LetsTalk Tour, a brand awareness campaign to help consumers have the talk about long term care planning I saw an opportunity to share my creativity. ‬..I stepped out of my comfort zone and asked to speak to our CEO, Tom McInerney, about some ideas I had for a commercial/video that might draw in another demographic. He referred me to Janice Luvera, the head of the Brand Team. As an avid fan of “The Walking Dead,” I thought the use of zombies in a video would bring a comical twist to the insurance scene, while teaching the public about our products. Who doesn’t love a great zombie story? Basing my ideas on the products I worked directly with, I focused on lifetime benefit features. Coming from a background in shooting video, making music, and photography, I was able to put together storyboards to pitch to the brand team. The idea was that the products would be irresistible to a zombie who lives forever….naturally. It also touches on facets of life that appeal to All: marriage, family and income. ..I went into this meeting not expecting much to come of my pitch, but the outcome was surprising and well worth taking the risk. I want to give my sincerest thank you to Tom McInerny and Janice Luvera for making this possible. Enjoy the video. ..Disclaimer: This is not an official Genworth ad. I am Genworth employee sharing my passion for my work...Watch the making of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJe77sAqGio..More of my work:.Music - http://www.soundcloud.com/2_ties.Pictures- http://www.facebook.com/2ties OR http://www.flikr.com/2ties.   .Follow me on Instagram - @2ties_^Tyler Rosado^http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHVGqOCLWNQ^2014-09-11 23:38:31

Self Storage REITs Proves Resilient^www.reit.com Spencer Kirk, CEO of Extra Space Storage (NYSE: EXR), said that the self-storage sector once again proved its resiliency during the most recent economic downturn. "Self storage was among the last property types to go into the recessions, and we think it will be among the first to come out," Kirk said. Going forward, Kirk said overall economic activity and population growth are among the key factors facing the sector in the second half of 2010. "Although it is going to be a long recovery, we are headed in the right direction," Kirk said. Kirk added that he expects public self storage REITs to gain greater market share, up from the current 11 percent of properties they currently hold.^NAREIT1^http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVWZo3UHla8^2010-07-22 19:28:02

Anke Weyer "Du" at CANADA^James Kalm finally gets a chance to visit the new Canada Gallery located at 333 Broome Street for this exhibition.  Anke Weyer has been a continuing presence with the gallery having been included in the gallery's first group show about ten years ago.  The pictures in this new selection are human scaled, reflecting a performative relationship between the canvas and the artist's body and its physical gestures.  Using a freewheeling mixture of acrylics and oil paint, and a "provisional" approach to presentation, Weyer extends a legacy of Abstract Expressionism with a "new media" aesthetic, at once knowing yet distanced through time and virtual information.^jameskalmroughcut^http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSqn7QWOA2c^2013-12-30 19:01:56
