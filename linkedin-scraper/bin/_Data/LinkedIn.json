Today that passion for math still stands unabated in me. I work on research projects in various fields, but all of them are ultimately tributaries of applied and computational mathematics. My doctoral research is in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics, where I work on developing high-order numerical techniques for solving non-linear hyperbolic PDEs. Over the past couple of years, I have developed a fascination for financial mathematics. Finance is a system run by humans - so unlike natural phenomena, the more we understand about this system, the more complicated it gets! I am currently working on a research project in the field of Peer-to-peer lending. I've also had great fun working on other team projects for project classes in investment science and statistical finance. Today, the development of algorithms is no longer a pure mathematics job. The architecture the algorithm is developed for dictates the structural core of the algorithms. During my intern at Robert Bosch, I worked on developing efficient linear algebra algorithms for a multi-CPU-GPU platform. I am also one of the developers of the open-source mixed platform CFD package HiFiLES. My dream is to help scientific and technological advancement through computational research. If you'd like to discuss math, aircrafts/rockets, war, technology, poker, chess, football or Youtube videos, feel free to contact me!
