to Inertial sensor calibration Studied functioning mechanism and characteristics of ultrasonic micromotors through design, fabrication, simulation and testing of various single phase driven silicon micromotors and arrived at the improved performance and reliability for potential uses in micro-optical systems, micro-sensor calibration, and position modulation • Demonstrated actuation and direction control of multiple gear-coupled surface micromachined whispering gallery mode ultrasonic motors. • Demonstrated levitation and a non-contact method of controlling the rotation rate and direction of the motor using thermal actuator driven gripper by modulating rotor – gripper gap in nanometer dimensions. • Demonstrated low voltage actuation of ultrasonic motors leveraging acoustic streaming due to thermal gripper. • Demonstrated measurement of angular motion of the ultrasonic motor from video recording of optical patterns diffracted from integrated gratings on the rotor paving way to precise position control of the rotor. • Designed a process flow and fabricated an optical gyroscope and explored ways to use the ultrasonic micromotor as a rotating platform for calibration of the gyroscope. • Published three first authored papers in top conferences in the field (Hilton Head, IEEE Transducers, IEEE

Crawling (Sitefetch): A web-scale system to crawl data from customer websites including some of the premium Internet Retailers of the world. Data Infrastructure (BloomStore): A Cassandra + SolrCloud based system to manage all of our customer's web content. The input to the system is both crawl and product feeds which are stored in Cassandra tables. Various hadoop based pipelines run on top of the data and enrich it. A subset of the data is then stored as Solr collections to power various search services. This is the content platform for all BloomReach products. Web Analytics: A platform to generate billing data based on a unique attribution model to measure uplift in Organic Search (Visits + Conversions) for our customers. The system processes Pixel logs and combines it with our data to generate stats using Hadoop. Insights for Organic Search: Analyze crawled content from websites. Provide actionable insights, reporting, etc. Canonicalization: System to identify and de-duplicate clusters of URLs which constitute the same page. The system uses a combination of URL based redundancy and content based de-duplication to identify URL clusters. Pages: Customer facing portal to create and edit new content which can be used in various marketing channels. Serving: A cloud-based API to serve data to customer websites through a REST API while adhering to stringent requirements for availability and latency.","start_date":"2010-03-01","end_date":"2015-08-03","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/268799?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"http://www.bloomreach.com","website":"http://www.bloomreach.com","industry":"Internet","type":"Privately Held","headquarters":"82 Pioneer Way\n\nMountain View,\nCA\n94041\nUnited States","company_size":"201-500 employees","founded":"2009","address":"82 Pioneer Way  Mountain View, CA 94041 United States"},{"title":"Advisor","company":"LambdaZen LLC","description":"LambdaZen is the maker of ConceptJS, a social cloud computing platform based on Javascript.

While retaining the strong academic atmosphere, ventured into F&B in college town Ithaca (NY) where one never really stops from engaging and interacting with intelligent peers and the vibrant community. Having felt that Asia, with huge potential in material resources and an even bigger challenge of efficient usage with the number of people that had to benefit from it, is where I had to be, back I am in Asia exploring my options and looking to learn and contribute.

Android: ----------- With Android and related frameworks development for the past 3 years and being at the forefront in handling new mobile technologies, my particular focus is in scaling mobile platform development end to end. Some of the interesting problems we face when we scale mobile development: - IDE setup and automated upgrades, integration with tests etc. (Ex: Android Studio, Gradle) - code reviews, principles, techniques and gatekeeping methodologies (Ex: gerrit , git) - CI environments: distributed builds, exploring cloud based solutions, running tests on wide variety of real devices. (Ex: Jenkins, mobile device lab), - Regression suites (all those automated unit tests, UI tests, localization passes running smoothly to ensure timely releases) - Releases - Google playstore policies, versioning schemes, alpha, beta programs etc.","picture":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/7/000/1d2/331/36ace75.jpg","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavanp\n","education":[{"name":"The Johns Hopkins University","description":"","period":"2003 – 2005"},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","description":"","period":"1999 – 2003"},{"name":"Tenali","description":"","period":""}],"groups":[{"name":"IIT Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=28006&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Google Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=36431&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=121564&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"IIT Madras Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1747&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"}],"websites":["http://www.microsoft.com"],"languages":[],"skills":["XML","Test Automation","Testing","Databases","Algorithms","Distributed Systems","C++","Software Engineering","Python","C","Software Development","Computer Science","Software Design","Operating Systems","Mobile Devices","Scalability"],"certifications":[],"organizations":[],"past_companies":[{"title":"Tech Lead, Build & Device Lab.","company":"Twitter","description":"* Provide top class build solutions to all of our amazing developers, both locally and in the CI environment. * Make sure our clients work on wide variety of devices out there in the wild, via our device lab. * Optimize those builds, profile them, make them performant. * Make code development easier, scalable and consistent with tons of check styles, lint rules etc. * Along with all of the above, still working on building the next gen android clients for Twitter","start_date":"2014-04-01","end_date":"2014-08-05","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/96622?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"https://about.twitter.com/","website":"https://about.twitter.com/","industry":"Internet","type":"Public Company","headquarters":"1355 Market St\nSuite 900\nSan Francisco,\nCA\n94103\nUnited States","company_size":"1001-5000 employees","founded":"2006","address":"1355 Market St Suite 900 San Francisco, CA 94103 United States"},{"title":"Software Engineer (Android Platform)","company":"Twitter","description":"* Building out a device lab to ensure our native clients work well on all those devices in the wild. * Scaling mobile development with next-gen cloud based build solutions. * Working on building the next gen android clients for Twitter.","start_date":"2013-10-01","end_date":"2014-08-11","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/96622?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"https://about.twitter.com/","website":"https://about.twitter.com/","industry":"Internet","type":"Public Company","headquarters":"1355 Market St\nSuite 900\nSan Francisco,\nCA\n94103\nUnited States","company_size":"1001-5000 employees","founded":"2006","address":"1355 Market St Suite 900 San Francisco, CA 94103 United States"},{"title":"Software Engineer (Mobile Automation)","company":"Twitter","description":"I focus on couple of areas at Twitter, with emphasis on mobile infrastructure and android automation. * Building up scalable mobile infrastructure, to be able to support continuous integration with Jenkins, build & release of native app projects, involving code bases contributed by 'n' engineers. * Also I work on the Android app automation.
