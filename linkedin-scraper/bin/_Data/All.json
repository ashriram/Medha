to Inertial sensor calibration Studied functioning mechanism and characteristics of ultrasonic micromotors through design, fabrication, simulation and testing of various single phase driven silicon micromotors and arrived at the improved performance and reliability for potential uses in micro-optical systems, micro-sensor calibration, and position modulation • Demonstrated actuation and direction control of multiple gear-coupled surface micromachined whispering gallery mode ultrasonic motors. • Demonstrated levitation and a non-contact method of controlling the rotation rate and direction of the motor using thermal actuator driven gripper by modulating rotor – gripper gap in nanometer dimensions. • Demonstrated low voltage actuation of ultrasonic motors leveraging acoustic streaming due to thermal gripper. • Demonstrated measurement of angular motion of the ultrasonic motor from video recording of optical patterns diffracted from integrated gratings on the rotor paving way to precise position control of the rotor. • Designed a process flow and fabricated an optical gyroscope and explored ways to use the ultrasonic micromotor as a rotating platform for calibration of the gyroscope. • Published three first authored papers in top conferences in the field (Hilton Head, IEEE Transducers, IEEE

Crawling (Sitefetch): A web-scale system to crawl data from customer websites including some of the premium Internet Retailers of the world. Data Infrastructure (BloomStore): A Cassandra + SolrCloud based system to manage all of our customer's web content. The input to the system is both crawl and product feeds which are stored in Cassandra tables. Various hadoop based pipelines run on top of the data and enrich it. A subset of the data is then stored as Solr collections to power various search services. This is the content platform for all BloomReach products. Web Analytics: A platform to generate billing data based on a unique attribution model to measure uplift in Organic Search (Visits + Conversions) for our customers. The system processes Pixel logs and combines it with our data to generate stats using Hadoop. Insights for Organic Search: Analyze crawled content from websites. Provide actionable insights, reporting, etc. Canonicalization: System to identify and de-duplicate clusters of URLs which constitute the same page. The system uses a combination of URL based redundancy and content based de-duplication to identify URL clusters. Pages: Customer facing portal to create and edit new content which can be used in various marketing channels. Serving: A cloud-based API to serve data to customer websites through a REST API while adhering to stringent requirements for availability and latency.","start_date":"2010-03-01","end_date":"2015-08-03","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/268799?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"http://www.bloomreach.com","website":"http://www.bloomreach.com","industry":"Internet","type":"Privately Held","headquarters":"82 Pioneer Way\n\nMountain View,\nCA\n94041\nUnited States","company_size":"201-500 employees","founded":"2009","address":"82 Pioneer Way  Mountain View, CA 94041 United States"},{"title":"Advisor","company":"LambdaZen LLC","description":"LambdaZen is the maker of ConceptJS, a social cloud computing platform based on Javascript.

While retaining the strong academic atmosphere, ventured into F&B in college town Ithaca (NY) where one never really stops from engaging and interacting with intelligent peers and the vibrant community. Having felt that Asia, with huge potential in material resources and an even bigger challenge of efficient usage with the number of people that had to benefit from it, is where I had to be, back I am in Asia exploring my options and looking to learn and contribute.

Android: ----------- With Android and related frameworks development for the past 3 years and being at the forefront in handling new mobile technologies, my particular focus is in scaling mobile platform development end to end. Some of the interesting problems we face when we scale mobile development: - IDE setup and automated upgrades, integration with tests etc. (Ex: Android Studio, Gradle) - code reviews, principles, techniques and gatekeeping methodologies (Ex: gerrit , git) - CI environments: distributed builds, exploring cloud based solutions, running tests on wide variety of real devices. (Ex: Jenkins, mobile device lab), - Regression suites (all those automated unit tests, UI tests, localization passes running smoothly to ensure timely releases) - Releases - Google playstore policies, versioning schemes, alpha, beta programs etc.","picture":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/7/000/1d2/331/36ace75.jpg","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavanp\n","education":[{"name":"The Johns Hopkins University","description":"","period":"2003 – 2005"},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","description":"","period":"1999 – 2003"},{"name":"Tenali","description":"","period":""}],"groups":[{"name":"IIT Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=28006&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Google Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=36431&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=121564&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"IIT Madras Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1747&goback=%2Enppvan_pavanp&trk=fulpro_grplogo"}],"websites":["http://www.microsoft.com"],"languages":[],"skills":["XML","Test Automation","Testing","Databases","Algorithms","Distributed Systems","C++","Software Engineering","Python","C","Software Development","Computer Science","Software Design","Operating Systems","Mobile Devices","Scalability"],"certifications":[],"organizations":[],"past_companies":[{"title":"Tech Lead, Build & Device Lab.","company":"Twitter","description":"* Provide top class build solutions to all of our amazing developers, both locally and in the CI environment. * Make sure our clients work on wide variety of devices out there in the wild, via our device lab. * Optimize those builds, profile them, make them performant. * Make code development easier, scalable and consistent with tons of check styles, lint rules etc. * Along with all of the above, still working on building the next gen android clients for Twitter","start_date":"2014-04-01","end_date":"2014-08-05","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/96622?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"https://about.twitter.com/","website":"https://about.twitter.com/","industry":"Internet","type":"Public Company","headquarters":"1355 Market St\nSuite 900\nSan Francisco,\nCA\n94103\nUnited States","company_size":"1001-5000 employees","founded":"2006","address":"1355 Market St Suite 900 San Francisco, CA 94103 United States"},{"title":"Software Engineer (Android Platform)","company":"Twitter","description":"* Building out a device lab to ensure our native clients work well on all those devices in the wild. * Scaling mobile development with next-gen cloud based build solutions. * Working on building the next gen android clients for Twitter.","start_date":"2013-10-01","end_date":"2014-08-11","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/96622?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"https://about.twitter.com/","website":"https://about.twitter.com/","industry":"Internet","type":"Public Company","headquarters":"1355 Market St\nSuite 900\nSan Francisco,\nCA\n94103\nUnited States","company_size":"1001-5000 employees","founded":"2006","address":"1355 Market St Suite 900 San Francisco, CA 94103 United States"},{"title":"Software Engineer (Mobile Automation)","company":"Twitter","description":"I focus on couple of areas at Twitter, with emphasis on mobile infrastructure and android automation. * Building up scalable mobile infrastructure, to be able to support continuous integration with Jenkins, build & release of native app projects, involving code bases contributed by 'n' engineers. * Also I work on the Android app automation.

Over the last two years I have been using first principles techniques in understanding the electronic and thermodynamic properties of perovskite surfaces and interfaces. My work primarily focused on the role of polar catastrophe and oxygen vacancies in the origin of novel physics in these systems. I am also interested in van der Waals structure like transition metal dichalcogenide, boron nitride and graphene. Currently, my research efforts are directed towards understanding and predicting novel material properties (transport, magnetism, non-trivial topology).","picture":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/8/005/05f/0db/21deaad.jpg","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/nikhil-sivadas/35/427/a92\n","education":[{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","description":"","period":"2010 – 2015"},{"name":"Carnegie Mellon University","description":"","period":"2010 – 2012"},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","description":"","period":"2006 – 2010"}],"groups":[{"name":"Carnegie Mellon Chicago Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2957606&goback=%2Enpp_nikhil*5sivadas%2F35%2F427%2Fa92&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Carnegie Mellon Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2221&goback=%2Enpp_nikhil*5sivadas%2F35%2F427%2Fa92&trk=fulpro_grplogo"}],"websites":[],"languages":[],"skills":["ABINIT","Quantum ESPRESSO","VASP","Wannier90","Unix","Mathematica","Gnuplot","ANSI C","Fortran","Condensed Matter Physics","Algorithms"],"certifications":[],"organizations":[],"past_companies":[{"title":"Summer Research Intern","company":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory","start_date":"2013-05-01","end_date":"2013-07-03","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/7999?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"http://www.ornl.gov/","website":"http://www.ornl.gov/","industry":"Research","type":"Government Agency","headquarters":"One Bethel Valley Road\n\nOak Ridge,\nTN\n37831\nUnited States","company_size":"1001-5000 employees","founded":"1943","address":"One Bethel Valley Road  Oak Ridge, TN 37831 United States"}],"current_companies":[{"title":"Research Assistant","company":"Carnegie Mellon University","start_date":"2010-08-01","end_date":"2015-08-10","linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/3147?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"http://www.cmu.edu","website":"http://www.cmu.edu","industry":"Higher Education","type":"Educational Institution","headquarters":"5000 Forbes Avenue\n\nPittsburgh,\nPennsylvania\n15213\nUnited States","company_size":"5001-10,000 employees","founded":"1900","address":"5000 Forbes Avenue  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 United States"}],"recommended_visitors":[{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jisha-vadake-muthiyil/51/6ba/836?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Jisha Vadake Muthiyil","title":"Data Science Analyst","company":"Adobe"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/geethu-sebastian/b1/218/72?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Geethu Sebastian","title":"Senior Architect, LnT Constructions","company":null},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rich-velis/27/4b8/b45?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Rich Velis","title":"Placement Manager","company":"DCI"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rahul-jee/47/b60/925?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Rahul Jee","title":"Revit Architect","company":null},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sukriti-sharma/86/35a/6b2?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Sukriti Sharma","title":"at","company":null},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rashmi-krishnan/16/55/4b9?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Rashmi Krishnan","title":"Graduate Research Assistant","company":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sindhu-a/66/aa4/530?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"sindhu A","title":"HR-Recruiter","company":"Innovature Technologies India Pvt.Ltd."},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/merin-abraham/25/2/71b?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Merin Abraham","title":"Student","company":"saintgits college of engineering"},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/vasavi-gupta/29/116/b89?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"vasavi gupta","title":"not working","company":null},{"link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mooppil-midhun/76/313/61?trk=pub-pbmap","name":"Mooppil midhun","title":"Student","company":"kvgdc"}]}

I work with earthquake engineering simulation group under the guidance of Dr. Swaminathan Krishnan at Caltech who conducts analytical research in the areas of earthquake engineering, structural dynamics, seismology, and computational mechanics, using high-performance computing. The focus of my research is to develop algorithms for generating stochastic seismic source models using historic and laboratory earthquake data. Currently, my work emphasizes on understanding the ground motion characteristics of large earthquakes in Southern California and on conducting design and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for tall steel structures. The end goal is to unify computational seismology and earthquake engineering in the form of rupture-to-rafters simulations for robust earthquake damage prediction, preparation, mitigation, and disaster response.","picture":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/5/005/08e/0f9/3522c11.jpg","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hemanth-siriki/42/a79/919\n","education":[{"name":"California Institute of Technology","description":"Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Civil Engineering (Minor: Geophysics)","period":"2009 – 2014"},{"name":"California Institute of Technology","description":"Masters of Science, Civi","period":"2008 – 2009"},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","description":"","period":"2004 – 2008"}],"groups":[{"name":"IIT Madras Alumni","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1747&goback=%2Enpp_hemanth*5siriki%2F42%2Fa79%2F919&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2259298&goback=%2Enpp_hemanth*5siriki%2F42%2Fa79%2F919&trk=fulpro_grplogo"}],"websites":[],"languages":[{"language":"English","proficiency":"Native or bilingual proficiency"},{"language":"Telugu","proficiency":"Native or bilingual proficiency"},{"language":"Hindi","proficiency":"Professional working proficiency"},{"language":"Tamil","proficiency":"Elementary proficiency"}],"skills":["Engineering","C++","Java","Matlab","Simulations","Mathematica"],"certifications":[],"organizations":[],"past_companies":[{"title":"doctoral student","company":"caltech","start_date":"2009-01-01","end_date":null,"linkedin_company_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/4992?trk=ppro_cprof","url":"http://www.caltech.edu","website":"http://www.caltech.edu","industry":"Research","type":"Educational Institution","headquarters":"1200 East California Boulevard\n\nPasadena,\nCalifornia\n91125\nUnited States","company_size":"1001-5000 employees","founded":"1891","address":"1200 East California Boulevard  Pasadena, California 91125 United States"},{"title":"Summer Intern","company":"M.

{"name":"Hari Bharadwaj","first_name":"Hari","last_name":"Bharadwaj","title":"Research Fellow at The MGH/HST Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging","location":"Greater Boston Area","country":"Greater Boston Area","industry":"Research","summary":"I am currently a Research Fellow at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH; Charlestown, MA). I recently finished my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory, Center for Computation Neuroscience and Neural Technology at Boston University, (Boston, MA). My recent efforts have been focused on investigating the mechanisms of various aspects of auditory perception using behavioural experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, EEG and fMRI. In particular, I am interested in how we are able to effortlessly attend to a sound source of interest amidst noise in everyday adverse settings where even the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms perform poorly (i.e., the cocktail-party problem). I am also interested in computational modeling of neural processes at a wide range of spatial scales to obtain further insight into the same and to develop better strategies to help hearing impaired listeners and to improve machine hearing. Broader interests include probabilistic modeling, dynamical Systems, signal processing, systems neuroscience and quantitative finance.","picture":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/2/005/081/09e/03acd62.jpg","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/hari-bharadwaj/10/539/278\n","education":[{"name":"Boston University","description":"","period":"2010 – 2014"},{"name":"University of Michigan","description":"","period":"2006 – 2008"},{"name":"University of Michigan","description":"","period":"2006 – 2008"},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","description":"","period":"2002 – 2006"},{"name":"Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore","description":"","period":"1995 – 2001"}],"groups":[{"name":"Boston University Hearing Research Center","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2912456&goback=%2Enpp_hari*5bharadwaj%2F10%2F539%2F278&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Brain-Computer Interface group","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1103077&goback=%2Enpp_hari*5bharadwaj%2F10%2F539%2F278&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Computational Neuroscience","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1376707&goback=%2Enpp_hari*5bharadwaj%2F10%2F539%2F278&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"EEG & MEG in Autism","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3863488&goback=%2Enpp_hari*5bharadwaj%2F10%2F539%2F278&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"Machine Learning Connection","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=70219&goback=%2Enpp_hari*5bharadwaj%2F10%2F539%2F278&trk=fulpro_grplogo"},{"name":"University of Michigan Biomedical Engineering","link":"http://www.linkedin.comhttp://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1693347&goback=%2Enpp_hari*5bharadwaj%2F10%2F539%2F278&trk=fulpro_grplogo"}],"websites":["http://www.haribharadwaj.com/"],"languages":[],"skills":["Signal Processing","Medical Imaging","Matlab","fMRI","EEG","Time Series Analysis","MRI","R","Python","Statistics","Mathematical Modeling","Image Processing","Audio Processing","Stochastic Modeling","Magnetoencephalography","Psychophysics","Brain-computer...","Data Analysis","Auditory Neuroscience","Electroencephalography","Machine Learning"],"certifications":[],"organizations":[{"name":"Association for Research in Otolaryngology","start_date":"2011-03-01","end_date":null},{"name":null,"start_date":null,"end_date":null}],"past_companies":[{"title":"Research Assistant","company":"Auditory Neuroscience Lab, Biomedical Engineering, Boston University","description":"Studied auditory attention and the peripheral, subcortical and cortical factors that determine performance in complex selective attention tasks at the individual level.

Would I do the same if I had to do it again … the answer is YES! My journey started when I boarded the British Air flight on August 3, 2003 from New Delhi (India) to Indianapolis (USA). It was an overwhelming beginning. I was coming to a country that I had only seen on the world map. I was uncertain about what and who I would become, but I was determined to significantly contribute to my field of study, which at that time was Physics. My first assignment after I entered the Physics Department at Purdue University was to teach an undergraduate physics lab to American students who were fresh out of high schools from all over Indiana. It was not the best first day for me – I was a fresh graduate from India with little experience in addressing an English speaking audience. However, I later realized that it was one of the most significant days of my life as this was the moment that opened the door to endless opportunities by giving me a confidence boost, which has stayed with me since. Science has always excited me and the pursuit of science to understand unknown scientific phenomenon has been very rewarding. It has given me an opportunity to be a contributing member of the scientific community. Teaching also appealed to me and it gave me the greatest thrill and feeling of accomplishment to see my students apply their skills to understand basic and complicated physical phenomena. For the next six years (2003-2009) I accomplished various landmarks in research (under the mentorship of my advisors Prof. Ronanld G. Reifenberger & Prof. Yong Chen) by publishing various scientific papers in journals like Nature Nanotechnology, Applied Physics Letters, Surface Science, Langmuir etc., with approximately 730 citations and 5 i10-index till date. -- To Continue Follow The Link

{"name":"Baiju Alexander","first_name":"Baiju","last_name":"Alexander","title":"Consultant at Ericsson","location":"Lund","country":"Sweden","industry":"Telecommunications","summary":"SUMMARY It has been a splendid 8+ years in the telecommunication industry where in I have enjoyed my work with wide range of challenging tasks in the embedded real-time domain. I started with work at IC and SR as a Project officer implementing software modules for GSM Base station on DSP processors, this project also gave me an opportunity to understand how a complete GSM system works. My main contributions were development of UL and DL RF frontend chain, buffer handling and synchronization. After that I joined SAIT for LTE software development. Where I worked on developing a LTE simulator. This work also involved interface with L23. Then I moved on to help Wavesat develop their LTE chipset. I took up the ownership of Open loop Channel Quality indicator module. My contribution included converting details from 3GPP specs to design document, designing interface with upper layers for CQI module, implementing modules on a multicore DSP platform and testing. Later I joined Ericsson for Testbed development where I could work with HETNET and Multiantenna Beamforming. In recent years I have worked in the physical layer domain of LTE Modem at ST-Ericsson and Ericsson. As part of the team I was involved in realization of Measurement and Cell search features. I also worked on power save feature for the modem. Apart from feature development I took keen interest in crash analysis and debugging. I also got opportunity to participate and fix critical customer issues during field trials.

Today that passion for math still stands unabated in me. I work on research projects in various fields, but all of them are ultimately tributaries of applied and computational mathematics. My doctoral research is in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics, where I work on developing high-order numerical techniques for solving non-linear hyperbolic PDEs. Over the past couple of years, I have developed a fascination for financial mathematics. Finance is a system run by humans - so unlike natural phenomena, the more we understand about this system, the more complicated it gets! I am currently working on a research project in the field of Peer-to-peer lending. I've also had great fun working on other team projects for project classes in investment science and statistical finance. Today, the development of algorithms is no longer a pure mathematics job. The architecture the algorithm is developed for dictates the structural core of the algorithms. During my intern at Robert Bosch, I worked on developing efficient linear algebra algorithms for a multi-CPU-GPU platform. I am also one of the developers of the open-source mixed platform CFD package HiFiLES. My dream is to help scientific and technological advancement through computational research. If you'd like to discuss math, aircrafts/rockets, war, technology, poker, chess, football or Youtube videos, feel free to contact me!
